- Conducted data preprocessing by applying label encoding to gender and one-hot encoding to geographical information, maintaining an 80:20 training-testing ratio.
  
- Constructed an artificial neural network (ANN) with 2 hidden layers, each with 6 neurons, using rectified linear activation functions, and employed a sigmoid function for binary classification in the output layer.

- Compiled the ANN with the Adam optimizer to improve convergence speed and training accuracy, resulting in a remarkable 86.05% accuracy in predicting customer churn. Additionally, created a customer ranking system based on churn probability, facilitating proactive retention strategies within the bank's customer base.
